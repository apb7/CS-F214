# Important Notes
## Prolog
- One of the key points about prolog is that it is a declarative programming language, and control flow of the program is pre-specified. If we draw the flowchart for a prolog program we will get an And-Or tree.  
i.e
  1. there is a OR between all the predicates listed.
  2. there is an AND between the statements written within a predicate (MOSTLY).
  3. there is a THERE EXISTS within a single predicate. i.e it returns true even if it finds a single correct match of all statements within a predicate
  4. there is a FOR EVERY between the overall predicates i.e all predicates are tested even after a matching predicate is found.
  5. we can convert THERE EXISTS to FOR EVERY for a single predicates by using 2 NOT's. For details refer to the comments in the code. (Though this is easy to code but makes the predicate only good for checking and not good for producing results - seems  related to P vs NP. Another way to achieve FOR EVERY is to use recurrsion)
  6. there is an OR between various solution that prolog proposes.

## Logic
- Logic in CS is a meta level course, we are doing proofs about proofs. Keeping this in mind makes the learning process quite easier.
